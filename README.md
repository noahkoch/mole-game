## How It Works 

It's basically like your standard high school track meet... but with spies.

The goal of the game is to either get your entire team to the finish line or to get the other team disqualified (because the best way to win is technically).

At the start of the game every participant is on step 2. The finish line is step 5.

Once a participant has been disqualified (DQ'd) they are out of the game and their character card will be revealed. They are no longer allowed to vote.

Once a participant finishes, they are safe. They can't be moved back or forwards, they can still vote and their identity is remains a secret.

## Game Play
![Starting Game Board](.github_images/starting-board.png?raw=true "Starting Game Board")


Each round has two stages.

#### Stage 1
In the first stage, everyone starts with their eyes closed.

Each character (except the runner) will be called upon one by one by the "ref". The moles are the only character (other than the runner) that will have more than one participant. When each character is called upon they can do their action (listed under "Characters" section) and then will close their eyes again once finished. 

Notice that the moles know who is on their team but the runners do not know who is a mole and who is a runner.

#### Stage 2
In the second stage everyone will open their eyes. 

All participants who are still eligible to vote (non DQ'd participants) will try to figrue out who is on what team. Participants will vote on another participant to move and whether they want to move them forward one step or backwards one step.


This all repeats until one entire team has been DQ'd or has finished.
